# Alarm Clock
## Aim
To build an alarm clock that acts as a suitable replacement for a phone alarm.

### Features
- Multiple alarms
  - Each alarm can be set to act on different days of the weeks
  - A 'repeat' feature, enabling sequences of alarms with 5-15 mintue intervals between alarms without needing to manually set multiple alarms.
- Custom music per alarm
- Automatic daylight savings changes
- Display time until next alarm
- Button to request current time audibly (to check time in the middle of the night without opening eyes)

## Hardware
Aim is to build initially with an Arduino Uno, with simple additional modules to achieve functionality first, and then where possible simplify and replace with components suitable for an appropriate scale clock with 3D printed enclosure.
